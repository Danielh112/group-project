This project is currently a Work-In-Progress

It is important to note that for the correct usage of APIs, it is required to make a copy of "example.properties" under 'src/resources'. Rename the copy to "config.properties" and replace the required fields with your information (such as private API keys).

Make sure NOT to track the new "config.properties" file to avoid the publication of private information on GitHub.
